# No-show-Appointments-DA
### Data Analysis for No show at Medical Appointments

In this project we investigate a dataset of 100K medical appointments in Brazil. The dataset contains various characteristics for each patient and whether or not he showed up to the appointment.

Exploring the data we aim to answer the following questions:
1) Which is the show up and no-show rate, for the given dataset?
2) Does waiting time and SMS receipt affect show or no show to an appointment? 
3) Are there any specific attributes,like for example age and gender,influence no shows?
